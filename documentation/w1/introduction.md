## Key Concept 
Boolean algebra, Boolean functions, gate logic, elementary logic gates, Hardware Description Language (HDL), hardware simulation.


## Introduction 
* Every Week:
    * Worry about a single level 
    * Take the lower level as given 
    * Implement the Higher level 
    * Test that it works
    
* Outcome: You have built a computer functioning computer
    *   That can run anything including games like Tetris
    *   Using only modest Nand gates
    *   You have experienced implementing abstractions
    *   You have learned what was needed for every step
